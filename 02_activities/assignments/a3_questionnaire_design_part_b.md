# Assignment: Questionnaire Design (Part B)

## Requirements
1. Comment on the quality of your sample. Do you expect it to be representative of your target population? Why or why not?

    ```

    The quality of the sample is strong due to the use of proportionate stratified sampling, which ensures that employees from all departments are included and that the sample size reflects the proportional distribution of departments across the company.
    This approach reduces selection bias and captures a broad representation of the target population. However, the reliance on the HR database as the sampling frame may exclude certain groups, such as new hires, and smaller departments might have fewer responses, limiting the depth of analysis for their specific issues.

    The sample is likely to be representative of the target population because proportionate stratified sampling ensures that employees from all departments are included in proportion to their size, maintaining a balanced view of the workforce. However, representativeness could be impacted by nonresponse bias if dissatisfied or disengaged employees are less likely to participate. To improve representativeness, efforts should be made to encourage participation and ensure anonymity to reduce the likelihood of biased responses.

2. Given the class content (error, survey quality, ethics) covered since Part A of the assignment, do you wish to make any changes to your original survey? If so, make a copy of your original survey and make any desired changes. Describe the changes and your reasoning. Provide a link here for submission.

    After learning about the new topics of error, survey quality, and ethics, I have decided to make some changes to my survey to improve its clarity, reduce biases, and ensure ethical standards are met. First, I have reordered the questions to move from general to specific topics, placing sensitive questions like reasons for leaving the company toward the end of the survey. This change minimizes priming effects and helps respondents feel more comfortable as they progress through the survey. Second, I have added a pre-survey introduction to emphasize the anonymity and confidentiality of responses, which encourages honest feedback and reduces nonresponse bias. Third, I simplified the wording of some questions, such as rephrasing "Do you feel you have enough opportunities to grow your skills?" to "Do you believe the company provides enough opportunities for career growth?" to ensure clarity and reduce measurement error. Fourth, I revised question options to improve neutrality by rephrasing "What is the most important factor affecting job satisfaction?" to "What is the most important factor contributing to job satisfaction?" and adding "Workplace culture" as a response option to capture a broader range of factors. Lastly, I refined the open-ended question to provide more guidance, changing it to "What specific change would you suggest to improve employee satisfaction and make the company a better place to work?" to reduce vague responses and focus on actionable insights. These changes collectively enhance the survey's quality and reliability while addressing ethical considerations and potential sources of error.

3. Could the purpose of your survey have been fulfilled through an observational study? If yes, how? If no, why not?

    ```
    write your answer here...
    I think the purpose of the survey could not have been fully fulfilled through an observational study because observational studies involve passively collecting data without directly engaging participants, which limits the ability to capture subjective experiences and motivations. While observational data might reveal trends, such as higher turnover rates in specific departments, it cannot provide insights into why employees are dissatisfied or leaving. The surveyâ€™s purpose is to understand factors like supervisor support, career growth opportunities, and workplace culture, which require employees to share their perceptions and opinions directly. Therefore, while observational studies could complement the survey by identifying patterns, they cannot replace it in addressing the subjective and actionable insights needed to fulfill its purpose.
